# Product Requirements Document (PRD): AuraYouth - Integrated AI-Powered Mental Wellness Platform for Youth

## 1. Document Overview
- **Product Name**: AuraYouth
- **Version**: 1.1 (Prototype Edition)
- **Authors**: - Synthesized from Research Report and Latest AI Trends
- **Purpose**: This updated PRD outlines the requirements for building a prototype of AuraYouth, an innovative AI-powered mental wellness platform for youth aged 13-24. It incorporates the research from the provided PDF on empathetic, confidential platforms but differentiates through predictive digital twins with youth-co-designed cultural adaptability, federated learning enhanced by differential privacy for data security, and proactive community-building. The prototype will use FastAPI for the backend and integrate trending AI technologies as of September 2025, such as multimodal intelligence, on-device AI, autonomous agents, RAG 2.0, and privacy-preserving LLMs like VaultGemma.
- **Scope**: Mobile app (iOS/Android) prototype with web portal for guardians/professionals. Focus on core features for MVP testing; end-to-end includes frontend, FastAPI backend, AI models, and basic data pipelines.
- **Target Audience**: Youth seeking mental wellness support; secondary users include guardians, mental health professionals, and educators.
- **Assumptions**: Prototype development assumes compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, EU AI Act). Use standard smartphones for on-device AI. Budget and timeline: 3-6 months for MVP.

## 2. Problem Statement
Youth mental health crises persist with anxiety, depression, and stigma barriers. Traditional therapy lacks accessibility, while existing AI tools (e.g., Woebot, Wysa) are reactive and unimodal. AuraYouth addresses this with a proactive, empathetic ecosystem that predicts downturns, ensures cultural sensitivity, and empowers users—while prioritizing ethical safeguards.

## 3. Solution Overview
AuraYouth prototype combines a confidential chatbot, multimodal sensing, predictive MHDT, and human oversight. Differentiation: Integrates 2025 trends like agentic AI for autonomous escalation, RAG 2.0 for personalized content retrieval, and on-device processing for privacy. "Echo Network" remains for peer support.

### How It Solves the Problem
- **Accessibility/Stigma**: Anonymous 24/7 access with on-device AI reducing data sharing.
- **Empathy/Personalization**: Multimodal fusion (e.g., EEG/ECG-inspired if wearables integrated) with RAG 2.0 for nuanced responses.
- **Proactive Prevention**: MHDT with agentic AI predicts and simulates outcomes.
- **Safety/Ethics**: Differential privacy and homomorphic encryption mitigate biases/risks.
- **Impact**: Targets 30% distress reduction; prototype validates via user testing.

## 4. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
**Predictive Cultural Empathy via Privacy-First Agentic Digital Twins**. 
- **Differentiation**: Unlike competitors, uses VaultGemma for privacy-preserving chat, MER2025-inspired multimodal models, and agentic AI for dynamic twins. Echo Network with autonomous moderation.
- **Value**: 2x engagement via trends like hyperautomation for seamless interventions.
